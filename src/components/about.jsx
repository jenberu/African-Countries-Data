      <h3>Fullstack Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Django-React full-stack developer and a 5
        <sup>th</sup>-year Software Engineering student at Bahir Dar University. 
        I am currently working with Intertechhub and Safaricom Talent Cloud, where I 
        apply my skills in web development to build innovative and impactful solutions. 
        Over the years, I have developed and worked on a range of exciting projects, 
        which you can explore further in the Projects section.
      </p>
      <p>
        These projects showcase my passion for technology and problem-solving, 
        as well as my ability to tackle complex challenges in both front-end and 
        back-end development, alongside continuous academic learning.
